# Mini-Project-

# Brief

The sorting app is a c# application which generates an array of a chosen length,
filled with random integers. The user is then prompted to choose a from a list
of sorting methods to sort the array. The sorted array is then displayed to the
user.

## How to use

Run the solution using the dotnet run command in console.

```powershell
    dotnet run
```

The program will then ask for an input in the format:

```powershell
    Input a length (> 0):
```

Once you have selected a valid length, you can then use the up and down arrow
keys to select which sorting algorithm you want to use. The current options that
are available are:

-   Bubble Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Selection Sort
-   Insertion Sort
-   Default Sort
